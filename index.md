## Well, well, look what the cat dragged in! Hello there.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [MemSQL][memsql], working on the [Engine Engineering][engine-engineering] team.

Previously I was a Software Engineer at [MySQL][mysql], [Oracle][oracle], working on the [Replication team][team].
Most of the time I worked on the [Paxos][paxos]-based [group communication engine][xcom] that powers [MySQL Group Replication][group replication].

In 2019 I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Universidade Nova de Lisboa][unl], advised by [Ricardo Dias][ricardo] and [João Lourenço][joao].

All opinions expressed here are my own.
