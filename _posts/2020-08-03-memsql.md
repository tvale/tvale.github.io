As of today I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [MemSQL][memsql], working on the [Engine Engineering][engine-engineering] team.

Previously I was a Software Engineer at [MySQL][mysql], [Oracle][oracle], working on the [Replication team][team].
Most of the time I worked on the [Paxos][paxos]-based [group communication engine][xcom] that powers [MySQL Group Replication][group replication].  
I had a wonderful experience at MySQL. I learned a lot during my time there, and I truly believe our relationship was mutually benefitial. I'm thankful for having worked there, and I wish everyone the best!
